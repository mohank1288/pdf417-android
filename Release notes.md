## 3.0.0
- support for obtaining multiple scan results from single camera frame
- API change:
    - `onScanningDone` method in BaseBarcodeActivity now receives list of scanning results instead of single scanning result
    - this list can have zero, one or more scan results
    - if multiple barcode recognizers are turned on and `shouldAllowMultipleScanResultsOnSingleImage` method of `Pdf417MobiSettings` returns true, list can have multiple scan data, otherwise it will have at most one element (similar behaviour as before)
- new key has been added for retrieving list of recognised objects via intent: `BaseBarcodeActivity.EXTRAS_RESULT_LIST`
    - you can obtain the list with following snippet:

            ArrayList<Pdf417MobiScanData> dataList = getIntent().getExtras().getParcelableArrayList(BaseBarcodeActivity.EXTRAS_RESULT_LIST);
